## Sanitized Assessment Sources

Use this folder to store the sanitized assessment artifacts that seed the demo and CSV conversion workflow.

- Place the sanitized Excel workbook (for example `Azure_Framework_2025_template_sanitized.xlsx`) here.
- Place the sanitized Word assessment report (for example `Cloud_Security_Assessment_Report_sanitized.docx`) here.
- Keep redacted companion exports – the sample questionnaire and report text files – under `demo/` for walkthroughs.

> Do **not** commit live customer data. Only sanitized or sample artifacts should live in this workspace.
