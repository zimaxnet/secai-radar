Executive Summary
1.1 Introduction
CONTOSO engaged Security partner Services (TCS) to perform the Cloud Security Assessment for their existing Azure cloud environments. This assessment exercise is conducted based on TCS Cloud Security Framework which encompasses multiple industry-standard cybersecurity practices and cloud benchmarks and standard security reference architectures. This report presents the analysis of existing security control implementations and identified gaps.
Following activities are performed as part of the assessment:
Conducted Azure Cloud Security Assessment.
Analysis of Cloud Infrastructure Asset inventory.
Captured response from the CONTOSO teams for understanding the usage of cloud subscriptions and the security controls deployed.
Identified existing gaps and improvement areas for strengthening the security posture of the underlying cloud environments.
Observations based on Security Frameworks and best practices.
1.2 Considerations & Limitations
Assessment is performed based on the limited available architecture documents (Azure only), documentation shared in the CONTOSOPEDIA and the limited read-only access to the cloud environments.
TCS team has collaborated with CONTOSO teams to overcome the limitations of documentation & access. CONTOSO team responses to TCS questionnaires are also a major input to this assessment.
1.3 Findings & Observations
CONTOSO developed policies, processes, and controls for information security, however there are still gaps in implementation as cloud environment.
The following strengths were identified:
The following major gaps were identified:
Objective
The objective of this overall cloud estate assessment is the following:
Collect cloud IT inventory that is currently present in CONTOSO MSA cloud environment.
Review overall cloud security across enterprise by conducting the following:
Understand the usage of cloud and its existing architecture.
Analyse the current state of security against different parameters as defined by the TCS Cloud security framework and best practices covering technical, process and documentation areas.
Identify security gaps.
Provide prioritized list of recommendations.
The overall strategy followed to deliver the assessment objectives by collating and review of the information and evidence gathered through various measures such as documentation collection and collaboration with various CONTOSO stakeholders.
Cloud Security Assessment:
TCS assessment team conducted point-in-time customized TCS cloud security assessment which is based on Azure Security Best Practices. Below is the key list of CONTOSO stakeholders who were involved with TCS Assessment team during the overall assessment.
TCS assessment team scheduled meetings and workshops with respective CONTOSO stakeholders to understand the cloud environment, the cloud usage, existing architecture and existing security policies and controls. The information provided by the CONTOSO stakeholders were then independently reviewed in the CSP portals, analysed for security gaps, aligned with the relevant stakeholders involved through follow up discussions and the same is reported.
Assessment Plan and Approach
Below are the assessment plan and approach that were followed by TCS assessment team during this engagement.
The assessment plan was for 6 weeks including final executive presentation and detailed report.
Detailed activities of each phase are listed below.
Consulted relevant SMEs to gather insights and validate configurations
Referred to Contosopedia for internal standards and best practices
Analyzed Azure environment for security posture and control implementation
Mapped findings against Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) controls
Current Maturity Levels in Framework & Benchmarks
CONTOSO cloud environment was also assessed for Microsoft Cloud Security Baseline (MCSB) security controls.
The compliance status of CONTOSO environment for Microsoft Cloud Security Baseline (MCSB) is as follows.
The detailed findings for the Microsoft Cloud Security Baseline (MCSB) are covered in the subsequent section.

Establish a cloud identity and privileged access approach as part of your organization’s overall security access control strategy. This strategy should include documented guidance, policy, and standards for the following aspects:
Centralized identity and authentication system (such as Azure AD) and its interconnectivity with other internal and external identity systems
Privileged identity and access governance (such as access request, review and approval)
Privileged accounts in emergency (break-glass) situation
Strong authentication (passwordless authentication and multifactor authentication) methods in different use cases and conditions.
Secure access by administrative operations through web portal/console, command-line and API.
For exception cases, where an enterprise system isn’t used, ensure adequate security controls are in place for identity, authentication and access management, and governed. These exceptions should be approved and periodically reviewed by the enterprise team. These exceptions are typically in cases such as:
Use of a non-enterprise designated identity and authentication system, such as cloud-based third-party systems (may introduce unknown risks)
Privileged users authenticated locally and/or use non-strong authentication methods

Establish a logging, threat detection and incident response strategy to rapidly detect and remediate threats and meet compliance requirements. Security operations (SecOps / SOC) team should prioritize high quality alerts and seamless experiences so that they can focus on threats rather than log integration and manual steps. This strategy should include documented policy, procedure and standards for the following aspects:
The security operations (SecOps) organization's role and responsibilities
A well-defined and regularly tested incident response plan and handling process aligning with NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide) or other industry frameworks.
Communication and notification plan with your customers, suppliers, and public parties of interest.
Simulate both expected and unexpected security events within your cloud environment to understand the effectiveness of your preparation. Iterate on the outcome of your simulation to improve the scale of your response posture, reduce time to value, and further reduce risk.
Preference of using extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities, such as Azure Defender capabilities, to detect threats in various areas.
Use of cloud native capability (e.g., as Microsoft Defender for Cloud) and third-party platforms for incident handling, such as logging and threat detection, forensics, and attack remediation and eradication.
Prepare the necessary runbooks, both manual and automated, to ensure reliable and consistent responses.
Define key scenarios (such as threat detection, incident response, and compliance) and set up log capture and retention to meet the scenario requirements.
Centralized visibility of and correlation information about threats, using SIEM, native cloud threat detection capability, and other sources.
Post-incident activities, such as lessons learned and evidence retention.

Mandate the security controls as part of the organization’s DevOps engineering and operation standard. Define the security objectives, control requirements, and tooling specifications in accordance with enterprise and cloud security standards in your organization.
Encourage the use of DevOps as an essential operating model in your organization for its benefits in rapidly identifying and remediating vulnerabilities using different type of automations (such as infrastructure as code provision, and automated SAST and DAST scan) throughout the CI/CD workflow. This ‘shift left’ approach also increases visibility and ability to enforce consistent security checks in your deployment pipeline, effectively deploying security guardrails into the environment ahead of time to avoid last minute security surprises when deploying a workload into production.
When shifting security controls left into the pre-deployment phases, implement security guardrails to ensure the controls are deployed and enforced throughout your DevOps process. This technology could include resource deployment templates (such as Azure ARM template) to define guardrails in the IaC (infrastructure as code), resource provisioning and audit to restrict which services or configurations can be provisioned into the environment.
For the run-time security controls of your workload, follow the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to design and implement effective the controls, such as identity and privileged access, network security, endpoint security, and data protection inside your workload applications and services.
