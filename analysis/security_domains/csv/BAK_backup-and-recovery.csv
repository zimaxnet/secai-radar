SEC-BAK-0001,Backup and recovery,BAK,Ensure regular automated backups,"Ensure backup of business-critical resources, either during resource creation or enforced through policy for existing resources.

For Azure Backup supported resources (such as Azure VMs, SQL Server, HANA databases, Azure PostgreSQL Database, File Shares, Blobs or Disks), enable Azure Backup and configure the desired frequency and retention period. For Azure VM, you can use Azure Policy to have backup automatically enabled using Azure Policy.

For resources or services not supported by Azure Backup, use the native backup capability provided by the resource or service. For example, Azure Key Vault provides a native backup capability.

For resources/services that are neither supported by Azure Backup nor have a native backup capability, evaluate your backup and disaster needs, and create your own mechanism as per your business requirements. For example:

If you use Azure Storage for data storage, enable blob versioning for your storage blobs which will allow you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Azure Storage.
Service configuration settings can usually be exported to Azure Resource Manager templates.","1. Are Azure Backup policies configured for all supported resources (VMs, SQL, HANA, PostgreSQL, File Shares, Blobs, Disks)?

SEC-BAK-0002,Backup and recovery,BAK,Protect backup and recovery data,"Ensure backup data and operations are protected from data exfiltration, data compromise, ransomware/malware and malicious insiders. The security controls that should be applied include user and network access control, data encryption at-rest and in-transit.

Use multi-factor-authentication and Azure RBAC to secure the critical Azure Backup operations (such as delete, change retention, updates to backup config). For Azure Backup supported resources, use Azure RBAC to segregate duties and enable fine grained access, and create private endpoints within your Azure Virtual Network to securely backup and restore data from your Recovery Services vaults.

For Azure Backup supported resources, backup data is automatically encrypted using Azure platform-managed keys with 256-bit AES encryption. You can also choose to encrypt the backups using a customer managed key. In this case, ensure the customer-managed key in the Azure Key Vault is also in the backup scope. If you use a customer-managed key, use soft delete and purge protection in Azure Key Vault to protect keys from accidental or malicious deletion. For on-premises backups using Azure Backup, encryption-at-rest is provided using the passphrase you provide.

Safeguard backup data from accidental or malicious deletion, such as ransomware attacks/attempts to encrypt or tamper backup data. For Azure Backup supported resources, enable soft delete to ensure recovery of items with no data loss for up to 14 days after an unauthorized deletion, and enable multifactor authentication using a PIN generated in the Azure portal. Also enable geo-redundant storage or cross-region restoration to ensure backup data is restorable when there is a disaster in primary region. You can also enable Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS) to ensure backups are restorable during zonal failures.","1. Is backup data encrypted (platform-managed keys or CMK in Key Vault)?

Monitor your Azure environment to ensure that all your critical resources are compliant from a backup perspective. Use Azure Policy for backup to audit and enforce such controls. For Azure Backup supported resources, Backup Center helps you centrally govern your backup estate.

Ensure critical backup operations (delete, change retention, updates to backup config) are monitored, audited, and have alerts in place. For Azure Backup supported resources, monitor overall backup health, get alerted to critical backup incidents, and audit triggered user actions on vaults.

Note: Where applicable, also use built-in policies (Azure Policy) to ensure that your Azure resources are configured for backup.","1. Are backup jobs (success/failure) continuously monitored in Backup Center?
