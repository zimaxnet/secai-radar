Use Azure Key Vault to create and control your encryption keys life cycle, including key generation, distribution, and storage. Rotate and revoke your keys in Azure Key Vault and your service based on the defined schedule and when there is a key retirement or compromise. Require a certain cryptographic type and minimum key size when generating keys.

When there is a need to use customer-managed key (CMK) in the workload services or applications, ensure you follow the best practices:

Use a key hierarchy to generate a separate data encryption key (DEK) with your key encryption key (KEK) in your key vault.
Ensure keys are registered with Azure Key Vault and implemented via key IDs in each service or application.
To maximize the key material lifetime and portability, bring your own key (BYOK) to the services (i.e., importing HSM-protected keys from your on-premises HSMs into Azure Key Vault). Follow the recommended guideline to perform the key generation and key transfer.

Implement access control using RBAC policies in Azure Key Vault Managed HSM at the key level to ensure the least privilege and separation of duties principles are followed. For example, ensure separation of duties are in place for users who manage encryption keys so they do not have the ability to access encrypted data, and vice versa. For Azure Key Vault Standard and Premium, create unique vaults for different applications to ensure the least privilege and separation of duties principles are followed.

Define the security requirements of the application. Ensure these requirements are adequately addressed in the threat modeling.
Analyze application components, data connections and their relationship. Ensure this analysis also includes the upstream and downstream connections outside of your application scope.
List the potential threats and attack vectors that your application components, data connections and upstream and downstream services may be exposed to.
Identify the applicable security controls that can be used to mitigate the threats enumerated and identify any controls gaps (e.g., security vulnerabilities) that may require additional treatment plans.
Enumerate and design the controls that can mitigate the vulnerabilities identified.

Define gating criteria to prevent vulnerable or malicious components being integrated and deployed into the environment.

The software supply chain security controls should at least include the following aspects:

Properly manage a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) by identifying the upstream dependencies required for the service/resource development, build, integration and deployment phase.
Inventory and track the in-house and third-party software components for known vulnerability when there is a fix available in the upstream.
Assess the vulnerabilities and malware in the software components using static and dynamic application testing for unknown vulnerabilities.
Ensure the vulnerabilities and malware are mitigated using the appropriate approach. This may include source code local or upstream fix, feature exclusion and/or applying compensating controls if the direct mitigation is not available.
If closed source third-party components are used in your production environment, you may have limited visibility to its security posture. You should consider additional controls such as access control, network isolation and endpoint security to minimize the impact if there is a malicious activity or vulnerability associated with the component.

For the GitHub platform, ensure the software supply chain security through the following capability or tools from GitHub Advanced Security or GitHub’s native feature:- Use Dependency Graph to scan, inventory and identify all your project’s dependencies and related vulnerabilities through Advisory Database.

Use Dependabot to ensure that the vulnerable dependency is tracked and remediated, and ensure your repository automatically keeps up with the latest releases of the packages and applications it depends on.

As part of applying the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to your DevOps infrastructure security controls, prioritize the following controls:

Protect artifacts and the underlying environment to ensure the CI/CD pipelines don’t become avenues to insert malicious code. For example, review your CI/CD pipeline to identify any misconfiguration in core areas of Azure DevOps such as Organization, Projects, Users, Pipelines (Build & Release), Connections, and Build Agent to identify any misconfigurations such as open access, weak authentication, insecure connection setup and so on. For GitHub, use similar controls to secure the Organization permission levels.
Ensure your DevOps infrastructure is deployed consistently across development projects. Track compliance of your DevOps infrastructure at scale by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (such as Compliance Dashboard, Azure Policy, Cloud Posture Management) or your own compliance monitoring tools.
Configure identity/role permissions and entitlement policies in Azure AD, native services, and CI/CD tools in your pipeline to ensure changes to the pipelines are authorized.
Avoid providing permanent “standing” privileged access to the human accounts such as developers or testers by using features such as Azure managed identifies and just-in-time access.

Deploy vulnerability assessment and threat detection capability into the production environment and continuously use these capabilities in the run-time.

Guidance for Azure VMs:

Use Azure Shared Image Gallery to share and control access to your images by different users, service principals, or AD groups within your organization. Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access your custom images.
Define the secure configuration baselines for the VMs to eliminate unnecessary credentials, permissions, and packages. Deploy and enforce configuration baselines through custom images, Azure Resource Manager templates, and/or Azure Policy guest configuration.
Guidance for Azure container services:

Use Azure Container Registry (ACR) to create your private container registry where granular access can be restricted through Azure RBAC, so only authorized services and accounts can access the containers in the private registry.
Use Defender for Containers for vulnerability assessment of the images in your private Azure Container Registry. In addition, you can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to integrate the container image scans as part of your CI/CD workflows.

When deploying strong authentication, configure administrators and privileged users first, to ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method, quickly followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to all users.

Azure AD supports strong authentication controls through passwordless methods and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Passwordless authentication: Use passwordless authentication as your default authentication method. There are three options available in passwordless authentication: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app phone sign-in, and FIDO2 security keys. In addition, customers can use on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.
Multi-factor authentication: Azure MFA can be enforced on all users, select users, or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors. Enable Azure MFA and follow Microsoft Defender for Cloud identity and access management recommendations for your MFA setup.
If legacy password-based authentication is still used for Azure AD authentication, be aware that cloud-only accounts (user accounts created directly in Azure) have a default baseline password policy. And hybrid accounts (user accounts that come from on-premises Active Directory) follow the on-premises password policies.

Behavioral patterns such as excessive number of failed login attempts, and deprecated accounts in the subscription, should be alerted.

Azure AD provides the following logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Microsoft Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins: The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.
Audit logs: Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
Risky sign-ins: A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
Users flagged for risk: A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.
Azure AD also provides an Identity Protection module to detect and remediate risks related to user accounts and sign-in behaviors. Examples of risks include leaked credentials, sign-in from anonymous or malware linked IP addresses, password spray. The policies in Azure AD Identity Protection allow you to enforce risk-based MFA authentication in conjunction with Azure Conditional Access on user accounts.

In addition, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can be configured to alert on deprecated accounts in the subscription and suspicious activities such as an excessive number of failed authentication attempts. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (such as SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to see account anomalies inside the individual resources.","1.	Are Azure AD risky sign-ins and user risk policies enforced?

Be mindful about different types of logs for security, audit, and other operational logs at the management/control plane and data plane tiers. There are three types of the logs available at the Azure platform:

Azure resource log: Logging of operations that are performed within an Azure resource (the data plane). For example, getting a secret from a key vault or making a request to a database. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type.
Azure activity log: Logging of operations on each Azure resource at the subscription layer, from the outside (the management plane). You can use the Activity Log to determine what, who, and when for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription. There is a single Activity log for each Azure subscription.

You must secure all roles with direct or indirect administrative access to Azure hosted resources.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Azure's default identity and access management service. The most critical built-in roles in Azure AD are Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator, because users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles. With these privileges, users can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment:

Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD as well as services that use Azure AD identities.
Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units.
Outside of Azure AD, Azure has built-in roles that can be critical for privileged access at the resource level.

Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.
Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.
User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources.
Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles in the Azure AD level or resource level with certain privileged permissions assigned.

In addition, users with the following three roles in Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) portal should also be restricted as they can be used to directly or indirectly manage Azure subscriptions.

Account Owner: Users with this role can manage subscriptions, including the creation and deletion of subscriptions.
Enterprise Administrator: Users assigned with this role can manage (EA) portal users.
Department Administrator: Users assigned with this role can change account owners within the department.
Lastly, ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business-critical systems.

SEC-PA-0007,Privileged access,PA,Follow just enough administration (least privilege) principle,"Follow the just enough administration (least privilege) principle to manage permissions at fine-grained level. Use features such as role-based access control (RBAC) to manage resource access through role assignments.

Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. Through RBAC, you can assign roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure portal.

The privileges you assign to resources through Azure RBAC should always be limited to what's required by the roles. Limited privileges will complement the just-in-time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and those privileges should be reviewed periodically. If required, you can also use PIM to define a time-bound assignment, which is a condition in a role assignment where a user can only activate the role within the specified start and end dates.","1.
