SEC-DEV-0001,DevOps security,DEV,Conduct threat modeling,"Perform threat modeling to identify the potential threats and enumerate the mitigating controls. Ensure your threat modeling serves the following purposes:

Secure your applications and services in the production run-time stage.
Secure the artifacts, underlying CI/CD pipeline and other tooling environment used for build, test, and deployment. The threat modeling at least should include the following aspects:
Define the security requirements of the application. Ensure these requirements are adequately addressed in the threat modeling.
Analyze application components, data connections and their relationship. Ensure this analysis also includes the upstream and downstream connections outside of your application scope.
List the potential threats and attack vectors that your application components, data connections and upstream and downstream services may be exposed to.
Identify the applicable security controls that can be used to mitigate the threats enumerated and identify any controls gaps (e.g., security vulnerabilities) that may require additional treatment plans.
Enumerate and design the controls that can mitigate the vulnerabilities identified.

Use threat modeling tools such as the Microsoft threat modeling tool with the Azure threat model template embedded to drive your threat modeling process. Use the STRIDE model to enumerate the threats from both internal and external and identify the controls applicable. Ensure the threat modeling process includes the threat scenarios in the DevOps process, such as malicious code injection through an insecure artifacts repository with misconfigured access control policy.

If using a threat modeling tool is not applicable, you should, at minimum, use a questionnaire-based threat modeling process to identify the threats.

Ensure the threat modeling or analysis results are recorded and updated when there is a major security-impact change in your application or in the threat landscape.","1. Has a threat model been developed for applications, CI/CD pipelines, and supporting

SEC-DEV-0002,DevOps security,DEV,Ensure software supply chain security,"Ensure your enterprise’s SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) or process include a set of security controls to govern the in-house and third-party software components (including both proprietary and open-source software) where your applications have dependencies. Define gating criteria to prevent vulnerable or malicious components being integrated and deployed into the environment.

The software supply chain security controls should at least include the following aspects:

Properly manage a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) by identifying the upstream dependencies required for the service/resource development, build, integration and deployment phase.
Inventory and track the in-house and third-party software components for known vulnerability when there is a fix available in the upstream.
Assess the vulnerabilities and malware in the software components using static and dynamic application testing for unknown vulnerabilities.
Ensure the vulnerabilities and malware are mitigated using the appropriate approach. This may include source code local or upstream fix, feature exclusion and/or applying compensating controls if the direct mitigation is not available.
If closed source third-party components are used in your production environment, you may have limited visibility to its security posture. You should consider additional controls such as access control, network isolation and endpoint security to minimize the impact if there is a malicious activity or vulnerability associated with the component.

For the GitHub platform, ensure the software supply chain security through the following capability or tools from GitHub Advanced Security or GitHub’s native feature:- Use Dependency Graph to scan, inventory and identify all your project’s dependencies and related vulnerabilities through Advisory Database.

Use Dependabot to ensure that the vulnerable dependency is tracked and remediated, and ensure your repository automatically keeps up with the latest releases of the packages and applications it depends on.
Use GitHub's native code scanning capability to scan the source code when sourcing the code externally.
Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to integrate vulnerability assessment for your container image in the CI/CD workflow. For Azure DevOps, you can use third-party extensions to implement similar controls to inventory, analyze and remediate the third-party software components and their vulnerabilities.","1.

Artifact repositories that store source code, built packages and images, project artifacts and business data.
Servers, services, and tooling that host CI/CD pipelines.
CI/CD pipeline configuration.

As part of applying the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to your DevOps infrastructure security controls, prioritize the following controls:

Protect artifacts and the underlying environment to ensure the CI/CD pipelines don’t become avenues to insert malicious code. For example, review your CI/CD pipeline to identify any misconfiguration in core areas of Azure DevOps such as Organization, Projects, Users, Pipelines (Build & Release), Connections, and Build Agent to identify any misconfigurations such as open access, weak authentication, insecure connection setup and so on. For GitHub, use similar controls to secure the Organization permission levels.
Ensure your DevOps infrastructure is deployed consistently across development projects. Track compliance of your DevOps infrastructure at scale by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (such as Compliance Dashboard, Azure Policy, Cloud Posture Management) or your own compliance monitoring tools.
Configure identity/role permissions and entitlement policies in Azure AD, native services, and CI/CD tools in your pipeline to ensure changes to the pipelines are authorized.
Avoid providing permanent “standing” privileged access to the human accounts such as developers or testers by using features such as Azure managed identifies and just-in-time access.
Remove keys, credentials, and secrets from code and scripts used in CI/CD workflow jobs and keep them in a key store or Azure Key Vault.

SEC-DEV-0006,DevOps security,DEV,Enforce security of workload throughout DevOps lifecycle,"Ensure the workload is secured throughout the entire lifecycle in development, testing, and deployment stage. Use Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark to evaluate the controls (such as network security, identity management, privileged access and so on) that can be set as guardrails by default or shift left prior to the deployment stage. In particular, ensure the following controls are in place in your DevOps process:- Automate the deployment by using Azure or third-party tooling in the CI/CD workflow, infrastructure management (infrastructure as code), and testing to reduce human error and attack surface.

Ensure VMs, container images and other artifacts are secure from malicious manipulation.
Scan the workload artifacts (in other words, container images, dependencies, SAST and DAST scans) prior to the deployment in the CI/CD workflow
Deploy vulnerability assessment and threat detection capability into the production environment and continuously use these capabilities in the run-time.

Guidance for Azure VMs:

Use Azure Shared Image Gallery to share and control access to your images by different users, service principals, or AD groups within your organization. Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access your custom images.
Define the secure configuration baselines for the VMs to eliminate unnecessary credentials, permissions, and packages. Deploy and enforce configuration baselines through custom images, Azure Resource Manager templates, and/or Azure Policy guest configuration.
Guidance for Azure container services:

Use Azure Container Registry (ACR) to create your private container registry where granular access can be restricted through Azure RBAC, so only authorized services and accounts can access the containers in the private registry.
Use Defender for Containers for vulnerability assessment of the images in your private Azure Container Registry. In addition, you can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to integrate the container image scans as part of your CI/CD workflows.
For Azure serverless services, adopt similar controls to ensure security controls ""shift-left"" to the stage prior to deployment.","1. Are VM/container images hardened with baseline configs (Shared Image Gallery, Azure Policy)?
