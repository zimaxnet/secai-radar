SEC-IR-0001,Incident response,IR,Preparation - update incident response plan and handling process,"Ensure your organization follows industry best practice to develop processes and plans to respond to security incidents on the cloud platforms. Be mindful about the shared responsibility model and the variances across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services. This will have a direct impact on how you collaborate with your cloud provider in incident response and handling activities, such as incident notification and triage, evidence collection, investigation, eradication, and recovery.

Regularly test the incident response plan and handling process to ensure they're up to date.

Update your organization's incident response process to include the handling of incidents in the Azure platform. Based on the Azure services used and your application nature, customize the incident response plan and playbook to ensure they can be used to respond to the incident in the cloud environment.","1.

This allows you to learn lessons from past incidents and prioritize alerts for analysts, so they don't waste time on false positives.

High-quality alerts can be built based on experience from past incidents, validated community sources, and tools designed to generate and clean up alerts by fusing and correlating diverse signal sources.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides high-quality alerts across many Azure assets. You can use the Microsoft Defender for Cloud data connector to stream the alerts to Microsoft Sentinel. Microsoft Sentinel lets you create advanced alert rules to generate incidents automatically for an investigation.

Diverse logs should be collected to track the activities of a potential attacker across the kill chain to avoid blind spots. You should also ensure insights and learnings are captured for other analysts and for future historical reference.

Use the cloud native SIEM and incident management solution if your organization does not have an existing solution to aggregate security logs and alerts information. Correlate incident data based on the data sourced from different sources to facility the incident investigations.

Ensure your security operations team can query and use diverse data sources that are collected from the in-scope services and systems. In addition, it sources can also include:

Identity and access log data: Use Azure AD logs and workload (such as operating systems or application level) access logs for correlating identity and access events.
Network data: Use network security groups' flow logs, Azure Network Watcher, and Azure Monitor to capture network flow logs and other analytics information.
Incident related activity data of from snapshots of the impacted systems, which can be obtained through:
The azure virtual machine's snapshots capability, to create a snapshot of the running system's disk.
The operating system's native memory dump capability, to create a snapshot of the running system's memory.
The snapshot feature of other supported Azure services or your software's own capability, to create snapshots of the running systems.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize your cloud resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the resources and environment where the incident occurred.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Microsoft Defender for Cloud is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Similarly, Microsoft Sentinel creates alerts and incidents with an assigned severity and other details based on analytics rules. Use analytic rule templates and customize the rules according to your organization's needs to support incident prioritization. Use automation rules in Microsoft Sentinel to manage and orchestrate threat response in order to maximize your security operation's team efficiency and effectiveness, including tagging incidents to classify them.","1.
