SEC-ID-0006,Identity management,ID,Use strong authentication controls,"Enforce strong authentication controls (strong passwordless authentication or multi-factor authentication) with your centralized identity and authentication management system for all access to resources. Authentication based on password credentials alone is considered legacy, as it is insecure and does not stand up to popular attack methods.
When deploying strong authentication, configure administrators and privileged users first, to ensure the highest level of the strong authentication method, quickly followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to all users.

Azure AD supports strong authentication controls through passwordless methods and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Passwordless authentication: Use passwordless authentication as your default authentication method. There are three options available in passwordless authentication: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app phone sign-in, and FIDO2 security keys. In addition, customers can use on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.
Multi-factor authentication: Azure MFA can be enforced on all users, select users, or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors. Enable Azure MFA and follow Microsoft Defender for Cloud identity and access management recommendations for your MFA setup.
If legacy password-based authentication is still used for Azure AD authentication, be aware that cloud-only accounts (user accounts created directly in Azure) have a default baseline password policy. And hybrid accounts (user accounts that come from on-premises Active Directory) follow the on-premises password policies.

For third-party applications and services that may have default IDs and passwords, you should disable or change them during initial service setup.","1. Is MFA enforced for all privileged accounts and end users via Conditional Access?

Use Azure AD conditional access for more granular access controls based on user-defined conditions, such as requiring user logins from certain IP ranges (or devices) to use MFA. Azure AD Conditional Access allows you to enforce access controls on your organization’s apps based on certain conditions.

Define the applicable conditions and criteria for Azure AD conditional access in the workload. Consider the following common use cases:

Requiring multi-factor authentication for users with administrative roles
Requiring multi-factor authentication for Azure management tasks
Blocking sign-ins for users attempting to use legacy authentication protocols
Requiring trusted locations for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication registration
