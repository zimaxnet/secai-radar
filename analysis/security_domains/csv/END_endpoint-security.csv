SEC-END-0001,Endpoint security,END,Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR),"Enable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities for VMs and integrate with SIEM and security operations processes.

Microsoft Defender for servers (with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integrated) provides EDR capability to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to deploy Microsoft Defender for servers on your endpoints and integrate the alerts to your SIEM solution such as Microsoft Sentinel.","1. Are all Azure VMs onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Servers (with Defender for Endpoint)?
2. Are EDR alerts integrated into Microsoft Sentinel or SIEM for investigation?

SEC-END-0002,Endpoint security,END,Use modern anti-malware software,"Use anti-malware solutions (also known as endpoint protection) capable of real-time protection and periodic scanning.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud can automatically identify the use of a number of popular anti-malware solutions for your virtual machines and on-premises machines with Azure Arc configured and report the endpoint protection running status and make recommendations.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is the default anti-malware solution for Windows server 2016 and above. For Windows server 2012 R2, use Microsoft Antimalware extension to enable SCEP (System Center Endpoint Protection). For Linux VMs, use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux for the endpoint protection feature.

For both Windows and Linux, you can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to discover and assess the health status of the anti-malware solution.","1. Is Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Windows) or Defender for Endpoint (Linux) enabled on all VMs?
2. Are third-party anti-malware solutions detected and health-monitored in Defender for Cloud?

Follow recommendations in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to keep all endpoints up to date with the latest signatures. Microsoft Antimalware (for Windows) and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (for Linux) will automatically install the latest signatures and engine updates by default.

For third-party solutions, ensure the signatures are updated in the third-party anti-malware solution.","1. Are malware signatures automatically updated on all Windows/Linux endpoints?
2. Are update failures (out-of-date signatures) flagged in Defender for Cloud?
