Enforce secure transfer in services such as Azure Storage, where a native data in transit encryption feature is built in.

Enforce HTTPS for web application workloads and services by ensuring that any clients connecting to your Azure resources use transport layer security (TLS) v1.2 or later. For remote management of VMs, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol.

For remote management of Azure virtual machines, use SSH (for Linux) or RDP/TLS (for Windows) instead of an unencrypted protocol. For secure file transfer, use the SFTP/FTPS service in Azure Storage Blob, App Service apps, and Function apps, instead of using the regular FTP service.

When there is a need to use customer-managed key in the services, use a secured key vault service for key generation, distribution, and storage. Rotate and revoke your keys based on the defined schedule and when there is a key retirement or compromise.

Use Azure Key Vault to create and control your encryption keys life cycle, including key generation, distribution, and storage. Rotate and revoke your keys in Azure Key Vault and your service based on the defined schedule and when there is a key retirement or compromise. Require a certain cryptographic type and minimum key size when generating keys.

When there is a need to use customer-managed key (CMK) in the workload services or applications, ensure you follow the best practices:

Use a key hierarchy to generate a separate data encryption key (DEK) with your key encryption key (KEK) in your key vault.
Ensure keys are registered with Azure Key Vault and implemented via key IDs in each service or application.
To maximize the key material lifetime and portability, bring your own key (BYOK) to the services (i.e., importing HSM-protected keys from your on-premises HSMs into Azure Key Vault). Follow the recommended guideline to perform the key generation and key transfer.

Note: Refer to the below for the FIPS 140-2 level for Azure Key Vault types and FIPS compliance/validation level.

HSM-protected keys in vaults (Premium SKU): FIPS 140-2 Level 2

Ensure certificates used by the critical services in your organization are inventoried, tracked, monitored, and renewed timely using automated mechanism to avoid service disruption.

Use Azure Key Vault to create and control the certificate lifecycle, including the creation/import, rotation, revocation, storage, and purge of the certificate. Ensure the certificate generation follows the defined standard without using any insecure properties, such as insufficient key size, overly long validity period, insecure cryptography and so on. Setup automatic rotation of the certificate in Azure Key Vault and supported Azure services based on the defined schedule and when a certificate expires. If automatic rotation is not supported in the frontend application, use a manual rotation in Azure Key Vault.

Avoid using a self-signed certificate and wildcard certificate in your critical services due to the limited security assurance. Instead, you can create public signed certificates in Azure Key Vault.

Harden your key vault service through access control, network security, logging and monitoring and backup to ensure keys and certificates are always protected using the maximum security.

Secure your cryptographic keys and certificates by hardening your Azure Key Vault service through the following controls:

Implement access control using RBAC policies in Azure Key Vault Managed HSM at the key level to ensure the least privilege and separation of duties principles are followed. For example, ensure separation of duties are in place for users who manage encryption keys so they do not have the ability to access encrypted data, and vice versa. For Azure Key Vault Standard and Premium, create unique vaults for different applications to ensure the least privilege and separation of duties principles are followed.
Turn on Azure Key Vault logging to ensure critical management plane and data plane activities are logged.
Secure the Azure Key Vault using Private Link and Azure Firewall to ensure minimal exposure of the service
Use managed identity to access keys stored in Azure Key Vault in your workload applications.
When purging data, ensure your keys are not deleted before the actual data, backups and archives are purged.
Backup your keys and certificates using Azure Key Vault. Enable soft delete and purge protection to avoid accidental deletion of keys.When keys need to be deleted, consider disabling keys instead of deleting them to avoid accidental deletion of keys and cryptographic erasure of data.
For bring your own key (BYOK) use cases, generate keys in an on-premises HSM and import them to maximize the lifetime and portability of the keys.
Never store keys in plaintext format outside of the Azure Key Vault. Keys in all key vault services are not exportable by default.
