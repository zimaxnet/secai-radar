SEC-PA-0001,Privileged access,PA,Separate and limit highly privileged/administrative users,"Ensure you identify all high business impact accounts. Limit the number of privileged/administrative accounts in your cloud's control plane, management plane and data/workload plane.

You must secure all roles with direct or indirect administrative access to Azure hosted resources.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Azure's default identity and access management service. The most critical built-in roles in Azure AD are Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator, because users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles. With these privileges, users can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment:

Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD as well as services that use Azure AD identities.
Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units.
Outside of Azure AD, Azure has built-in roles that can be critical for privileged access at the resource level.

Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.
Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.
User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources.
Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles in the Azure AD level or resource level with certain privileged permissions assigned.

In addition, users with the following three roles in Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) portal should also be restricted as they can be used to directly or indirectly manage Azure subscriptions.

Account Owner: Users with this role can manage subscriptions, including the creation and deletion of subscriptions.
Enterprise Administrator: Users assigned with this role can manage (EA) portal users.
Department Administrator: Users assigned with this role can change account owners within the department.
Lastly, ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business-critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.","1.

SEC-PA-0005,Privileged access,PA,Set up emergency access,"Set up emergency access to ensure that you are not accidentally locked out of your critical cloud infrastructure (such as your identity and access management system) in an emergency.

Emergency access accounts should be rarely used and can be highly damaging to the organization if compromised, but their availability to the organization is also critically important for the few scenarios when they are required.

To prevent being accidentally locked out of your Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account (e.g., an account with Global Administrator role) for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or ""break glass"" scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency. You may also use additional controls, such dual controls (e.g., splitting the credential into two pieces and giving it to separate persons) to enhance the security of this process. You should also monitor the sign-in and audit logs to ensure that emergency access accounts are only used when authorized.","1.

The PAW should be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration, including strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, and restricted logical and network access.

Use features such as role-based access control (RBAC) to manage resource access through role assignments.

Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to manage Azure resource access through role assignments. Through RBAC, you can assign roles to users, groups, service principals, and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and the Azure portal.

The privileges you assign to resources through Azure RBAC should always be limited to what's required by the roles. Limited privileges will complement the just-in-time (JIT) approach of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and those privileges should be reviewed periodically. If required, you can also use PIM to define a time-bound assignment, which is a condition in a role assignment where a user can only activate the role within the specified start and end dates.","1.
