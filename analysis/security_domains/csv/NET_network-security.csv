SEC-NET-0001,Network security,NET,Establish network segmentation boundaries,"Ensure that your virtual network deployment aligns to your enterprise segmentation strategy defined in the GS-2 security control. Any workload that could incur higher risk for the organization should be in isolated virtual networks.

Create a virtual network (VNet) as a fundamental segmentation approach in your Azure network, so resources such as VMs can be deployed into the VNet within a network boundary. To further segment the network, you can create subnets inside VNet for smaller sub-networks.

Use network security groups (NSG) as a network layer control to restrict or monitor traffic by port, protocol, source IP address, or destination IP address. Refer to NS-7: Simplify network security configuration to use Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG hardening rules based on threat intelligence and traffic analysis result.

You can also use application security groups (ASGs) to simplify complex configuration. Instead of defining policy based on explicit IP addresses in network security groups, ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.","1.

Deploy private endpoints for all Azure resources that support the Private Link feature to establish a private access point for the resources. Using Private Link will keep the private connection from routing through the public network.

Note: Certain Azure services may also allow private communication through the service endpoint feature, though it is recommended to use Azure Private Link for secure and private access to services hosted on Azure platform.

For certain services, you can choose to deploy VNet integration for the service where you can restrict the VNET to establish a private access point for the service.

You also have the option to configure the service native network ACL rules or simply disable public network access to block access from public networks.

For Azure VMs, unless there is a strong use case, you should avoid assigning public IPs/subnet directly to the VM interface and instead use gateway or load balancer services as the front-end for access by the public network.","1.

You can also use firewalls between internal segments to support a segmentation strategy. If required, use custom routes for your subnet to override the system route when you need to force the network traffic to go through a network appliance for security control purposes.

Use Azure Firewall to provide fully stateful application layer traffic restriction (such as URL filtering) and/or central management over a large number of enterprise segments or spokes (in a hub/spoke topology).

If you have a complex network topology, such as a hub/spoke setup, you may need to create user-defined routes (UDR) to ensure the traffic goes through the desired route.
