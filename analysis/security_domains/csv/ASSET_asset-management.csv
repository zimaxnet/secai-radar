SEC-ASSET-0001,Asset management,ASSET,Track asset inventory and their risks,"Track your asset inventory by query and discover all your cloud resources. Logically organize your assets by tagging and grouping your assets based on their service nature, location, or other characteristics. Ensure your security organization has access to a continuously updated inventory of assets.

Ensure your security organization can monitor the risks to cloud assets by always having security insights and risks aggregated centrally.

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud inventory feature and Azure Resource Graph can query for and discover all resources in your subscriptions, including Azure services, applications, and network resources. Logically organize assets according to your organization's taxonomy using tags as well as other metadata in Azure (Name, Description, and Category).

Ensure that security organizations have access to a continuously updated inventory of assets on Azure. Security teams often need this inventory to evaluate their organization's potential exposure to emerging risks, and as an input for continuous security improvements.

Ensure security organizations are granted Security Reader permissions in your Azure tenant and subscriptions so they can monitor for security risks using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Security Reader permissions can be applied broadly to an entire tenant (Root Management Group) or scoped to management groups or specific subscriptions.","1.

SEC-ASSET-0004,Asset management,ASSET,Limit access to asset management,"Limit users' access to asset management features, to avoid accidental or malicious modification of the assets in your cloud.

Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources (assets) in Azure. Use Azure AD Conditional Access to limit users' ability to interact with Azure Resource Manager by configuring ""Block access"" for the ""Microsoft Azure Management"" App.

Use Azure Role-based Access Control (Azure RBAC) to assign roles to identities to control their permissions and access to Azure resources. For example, a user with only the 'Reader' Azure RBAC role can view all resources, but is not allowed to make any changes.

Use Resource Locks to prevent either deletions or modifications to resources. Resource Locks may also be administered through Azure Blueprints.","1.	Who is permitted to manage Azure resources (create, modify, delete)?

Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud adaptive application controls to discover and generate an application allow list. You can also use ASC adaptive application controls to ensure that only authorized software can executes, and all unauthorized software is blocked from executing on Azure Virtual Machines.

Use Azure Automation Change Tracking and Inventory to automate the collection of inventory information from your Windows and Linux VMs. Software name, version, publisher, and refresh time information are available from the Azure portal. To get the software installation date and other information, enable guest-level diagnostics and direct the Windows Event Logs to a Log Analytics workspace.

Depending on the type of scripts, you can use operating system-specific configurations or third-party resources to limit users' ability to execute scripts in Azure compute resources.

You can also use a third-party solution to discover and identify unapproved software.","1.	Are application allowlists defined and enforced for Azure VMs?
