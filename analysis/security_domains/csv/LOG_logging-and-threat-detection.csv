Configure your alert filtering and analytics rules to extract high-quality alerts from log data, agents, or other data sources to reduce false positives.

For threat detection not included in Microsoft Defender services, refer to Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark service baselines for the respective services to enable the threat detection or security alert capabilities within the service. Ingest alerts and log data from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft 365 Defender, and log data from other resources into your Azure Monitor or Microsoft Sentinel instances to build analytics rules, which detect threats and create alerts that match specific criteria across your environment.

For Operational Technology (OT) environments that include computers that control or monitor Industrial Control System (ICS) or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) resources, use Microsoft Defender for IoT to inventory assets and detect threats and vulnerabilities.

For services that do not have a native threat detection capability, consider collecting the data plane logs and analyze the threats through Microsoft Sentinel.","1.	Which Azure services have Defender threat detection enabled?

Behavioral patterns such as excessive number of failed login attempts, and deprecated accounts in the subscription, should be alerted.

Azure AD provides the following logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Microsoft Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:

Sign-ins: The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.
Audit logs: Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
Risky sign-ins: A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
Users flagged for risk: A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.
Azure AD also provides an Identity Protection module to detect and remediate risks related to user accounts and sign-in behaviors. Examples of risks include leaked credentials, sign-in from anonymous or malware linked IP addresses, password spray. The policies in Azure AD Identity Protection allow you to enforce risk-based MFA authentication in conjunction with Azure Conditional Access on user accounts.

In addition, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can be configured to alert on deprecated accounts in the subscription and suspicious activities such as an excessive number of failed authentication attempts. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (such as SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to see account anomalies inside the individual resources.","1.	Are Azure AD risky sign-ins and user risk policies enforced?

Enable logging capability for resources at the different tiers, such as logs for Azure resources, operating systems and applications inside in your VMs and other log types.

Be mindful about different types of logs for security, audit, and other operational logs at the management/control plane and data plane tiers. There are three types of the logs available at the Azure platform:

Azure resource log: Logging of operations that are performed within an Azure resource (the data plane). For example, getting a secret from a key vault or making a request to a database. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type.
Azure activity log: Logging of operations on each Azure resource at the subscription layer, from the outside (the management plane). You can use the Activity Log to determine what, who, and when for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription. There is a single Activity log for each Azure subscription.
Azure Active Directory logs: Logs of the history of sign-in activity and audit trail of changes made in the Azure Active Directory for a particular tenant.
