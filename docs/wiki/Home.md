# SecAI Radar - Documentation Wiki

Welcome to the SecAI Radar documentation wiki. This wiki provides comprehensive guidance for users, administrators, and developers working with SecAI Radar.

## What is SecAI Radar?

SecAI Radar is an open-source, cloud-security assessment application that:

1. **Collects** configuration and evidence from cloud resources
2. **Normalizes** evidence into a common "controls/domains" data model
3. **Uses AI** to explain security posture and identify gaps
4. **Generates** human-readable assessment reports (Markdown/HTML/DOCX)

SecAI Radar is designed to be **vendor-agnostic** and **generic**—no hardcoded customer names, vendor names, or consulting firm names.
