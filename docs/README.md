## What is an ADR?
An **Architecture Decision Record** is a lightweight design note that captures:
- the **context** and problem
- the **decision** taken
- the **options** considered
- the **consequences** (trade-offs, follow-ups)

ADRs prevent "why did we choose this?" amnesia and speed up onboarding and audits.
