### Design Requirements

**Visual Presence:**

- All 7 agents visible simultaneously (sidebar, panel, or grid)
- Diverse representation, professional appearance
- Status indicators (available, speaking, thinking)

**Voice Interaction:**
- Large microphone button with visual feedback

**Layout Structure:**
- Main content area (center) for assessment workflows
- Agent panel (right sidebar or floating) with all 7 agents
- Voice interaction zone (bottom or integrated)
- Agent detail view (modal/slide-out when selected)

**Design Style:**
- Corporate professional (like Azure Portal but more engaging)
- Modern and compelling (not boring corporate UI)
- Suitable for enterprise security assessments
- Dark/light mode support
- Responsive (desktop, tablet)

**Interaction Flow:**
1. User sees all agents available
2. Clicks agent or activates microphone
3. Agent avatar animates (listening → thinking → speaking)
4. Voice response with text transcript
5. Natural conversation continues

**Visual Elements:**
- High-quality agent avatars (diverse, professional)
- Voice waveform visualization
- Status indicators
- Conversation threads organized by agent
- Context awareness (current page/workflow)
- Quick action buttons for common queries

### Technical Context

- **Voice Technology**: Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech

- **Responses**: Reflect each agent's expertise and personality
- **Performance**: Smooth animations, responsive interactions

### Deliverables Needed

- Overall layout/wireframe
- Agent avatar designs for all 7 agents
- Voice interaction UI components
- State variations (listening, speaking, thinking, idle)
- Responsive layouts (desktop, tablet)
- Color palette and typography
- Animation concepts for agent interactions

### Success Criteria

The design must be:
- Compelling (users want to interact)
- Professional (corporate appropriate)
- Intuitive (easy voice interaction)
- Engaging (agents feel alive)
- Accessible (works for all users)

**Focus on making each agent visually distinct and giving them a "presence" that makes users want to have conversations with them. The voice interaction should feel natural and bring each agent's personality and expertise to life.**
